# Rep4_Sequence_Tools
* small and helpful scripts for me
* add Rep4 to `~/.bashrc`

## cb_tools_pointmutations.sh
* get pointmutations of a beta-lactamase group in a nice excel (.csv)

## cb_tools_remove_lines_to_dot.sh
* corrects the stupidity of seqsphere...
  * changes the "-" back to "." in filenames

## cb_tools_read-blast_resistance-DB.sh
* small tool do convert fastq to fasta while removing reads smaller than 1000bp
* it blasts these reads against the beta-lactamase database
* so you need **Rep1_script_pipelines** installed
